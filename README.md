# Circumnavigational Combat

Small arcade-style game build for the Google Cardboard platform as a part of a class at school.

## About the game

Tap to shoot, shoot the red capsules as they approach. Continue doing this until you die(take 3 damage). Try for a high score!

## Is this a game?

I would say that this is certainly a game. Following the 6 aspects of a game:

1) Fixed Rules

This game definitely has fixed rules within it, namely the way that the score increases when you hit an enemy, the enemies spawn in a particular pattern on a particular timer, and the player takes damage when an enemy gets too close, losing when they run out of health.

2) Variable and Quantifiable Outcome

The game certainly has a variable outcome, dependent on how many enemies the player is able to shoot. It is also quantifiable, represented by the score presented to the player at the end of the game.

3) Valorization of the Outcome

There is a concrete way of representing what outcomes are better than others, simply by ranking the scores with higher scores being better than lower ones.

4) Player Effort

The outcome(score) is entirely dependent on the player's ability to find and shoot the enemies before they get too close, meaning that the score is dependent on their efforts and abilities.

5) Attachment of the Player to the Outcome

The player can be attached to the idea of getting a higher score, particularly with the high score feature allowing them to track their improvement.

6) Negotiable Consequences

There are no inherent real-world consequences to doing poorly in the game, beyond potentially hurting oneself or damaging things around them if the player did not clear their play area well enough and was moving around too much.

Because my game meets all 6 criteria, I would judge that it is, in fact, a game.
